<body class="about-me">
  <p>
    I am a beginner programmer who has dabbled in languages such as Java, C#, and
    my newest language HTML and CSS.  Coding has always been interesting to me and
    I am always learning new things everyday.  If you wanna check out my projects
    page that is where I post all of my current projects and even my past completed
    projects.  If you would like to get in touch with me you can find my email at
    the bottom of this page or you can go to my LinkedIn and contact me there!
    Thanks again for visiting.
