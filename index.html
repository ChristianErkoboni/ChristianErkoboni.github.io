  <h1>Christian Erkoboni </h1>
  <p> Welcome to my website which I have personally
    designed using HTML and CSS.  Here you will be able
    to view all the projects I have been working and have completed.
    You will also be able to find my contact information like Email,
    LinkedIn, and Twitter.  Thank you for visiting!
  </p>
  <p> I am a beginner programmer who has dabbled in languages such as Java, C#, and
  my newest language HTML and CSS.  Coding has always been interesting to me and
  I am always learning new things everyday.  If you wanna check out my projects
  page that is where I post all of my current projects and even my past completed
  projects.  If you would like to get in touch with me you can find my email at
  the bottom of this page or you can go to my LinkedIn and contact me there!
  Thanks again for visiting.
